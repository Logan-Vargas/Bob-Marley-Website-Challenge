    <H1>Bob Marley 2</H1>
    <h5 id="h5one">Early Life and career</h5>
    <p id="pone">Bob Marley was born 6 February 1945 on the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann
        Parish,
        Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley (1885-1955) and Cedella Booker (1926-2008).[12] Norval Marely was a white
        Jamaican originally from Sussex, England, whose famaily claimed Syrian Jewish origins.[13][14][15] Norval
        claimed to have been a captian in the Royal Marines;[16] at the time of his marraige to Cedella Booker, and
        Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, he was employed as a plantation overseer.[16][17]</p>
    <h5 id="h5two">Musical career</h5>
    <p id="ptwo">In February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "Judge Not", "One Cup of Coffee", "Do You Still Love Me?"
        and
        "Terror", at Federal Studios for local music producer Leslie Kong.[31] Three of the songs were released on
        Beverley's with "One Cup of Coffee" being released under the pseudonym Bobby Martell.[32]

    <h5 id="h5three">Illness and Death</h5>
    <p id="pthree">In july 1977, Marley was found to have a typoe of malignant melanoma unter the nail of a toe.
        COntrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by and injury during a football match that year
        but was instead a symptom of already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have hus toe
        amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beleifs, and instead, the nail
        and nail bed were removed and a skin graft was taken from his thigh to cover the area.[</p>
